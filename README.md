# IoT-Based-Earthquake-Early-Detection-Alerting-System
This project has created a prototype using a low-cost sensor with the esp8266. It uses an analogue sensor which is sampled by the esp8266’s 10-bit ADC.
It connects to Cayenne. If the device triggers a pre-determined threshold Cayenne generates an SMS warning of an earthquake.
The aim of the IoT Based Earthquake Early Detection and Alerting System is to detect the earthquake early and notify the users.
